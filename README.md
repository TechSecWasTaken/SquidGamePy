All of the code that's provided runs on a command prompt,
and to launch it you will need *Python*! 
Also keep in mind that this is CASE SENSITIVE!
So for the Marble Game you will have to type "even" or "odd"
Also for the Stepping Stones game you have to type "left" to "right"!

# Games

The 2 games I selected were:

The Marble Game
and
Stepping Stones

# Marble Game

Rules:
The way to play this game is by guessing if the wager the opponent has is even or odd.
But since we're not using partners, the code chooses.
You guess if the wager is even or odd, and if you're correct
you get the amount of marbles that were in the wager.
If not, you lose the amount of marbles that were in the wager.
Get 20 marbles to win, and 0 to lose.

# Stepping Stones

For people who don't know, this is the glass panel game that's in Squid Game.
Just guess if the correct path is left or right. If you're wrong, you lose immediately.
